# Numbers Containing Digit 3
## Description:
This program finds and prints all numbers between 1 and 10000 that contain the digit 3. The program iterates over the numbers in the range, converts each number to a string, and checks if the digit '3' is present in the string. If it is, the program adds the number to a list, which is then printed to the console.
